# Openstreetmap India

[Openstreetmap.in](http://openstreetmap.in) is the Indian part of the Opensstreetmap project - The Free Wiki World Map! We help improve the Indian map on OSM by constantly including high quality geospatial data which is free to use

under the [ODbL](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) license.


<br>OSM History

[Openstreetmap.org](http://openstreetmap.org) (OSM) was created by Steve Coast in 2004. One of the main motivation for the project for Steve Coast was the success of Wikipedia and unavailability of quality spatial data for public use.

Today the OSM community have more than 2 million registered users who contributes spacial data across the globe. Most of these data is collected using a  manual survey using GPS devices, or is traced using

OSM map editors with the help of Satellite imagery which are free to use. OSM is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in England.
